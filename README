o Version

 This is bioperl-dev version 1.6.9, a developer release.

o Description 
 
 bioperl-dev contains experimental modules intended to expand the
 Bioperl envelope. New ideas for future point and stable releases
 are being explored here. Interested users are encouraged to 
 give these a try, keeping in mind the following points:

 o the modules here will likely depend on the current HEAD 
   revision of Bioperl (bioperl-live/trunk); a release version 
   may not suffice;

 o documentation is likely to be spotty at best;
 
 o the code should be considered unsupported, though a polite email
   to the dev is likely to elicit a positive response;

 o the code should not be considered "production quality"; when this
   level is reached, bioperl-dev modules will graduate to the 
   core or the appropriate specialty package.

 See the Changes file for more information about what is contained in
 here.

o Installation

 See the accompanying INSTALL file for details on installing
 bioperl-dev
 
o Feedback

Write down any problems or praise and send them to 
bioperl-l@bioperl.org  ;-)
