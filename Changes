Revision history for bioperl-dev modules

Full details of changes between all versions are available online at:
http://www.bioperl.org/wiki/Change_log


1.6.9 Sync version number with current trunk

    o The intention is to indicate a link to the current release
      (1.6), but force the use of the trunk; the Build.PL stub (based
      on bioperl-run/Build.PL)

    o Let the games begin. 

0.01 Initial population of bioperl-dev

    o Created a basic distribution structure, ripping from
      bioperl-live/trunk some basic tools:

      - Bio/Root/* revision 15615

      - t/* revision 15615, with t/data stub only and full t/lib

      - a functional but stubby Build.PL
