bioperl-dev INSTALLATION

INSTALL THE RIGHT BIOPERL

You need the latest developer snapshot of Bioperl for the highest
probability of success. The bioperl-dev repository contains highly
experimental code, and is likely to depend on the very latest commits.
For instructions on installing latest revision, bioperl-live/trunk,
see http://www.bioperl.org/wiki/Using_Subversion.

INSTALLATION

Installation instructions at the following address apply here:
http://www.bioperl.org/wiki/Installing_Bioperl_for_Unix
The next section summarizes the essential points from there.

INSTALLATION FROM SVN CHECKOUT

Check out a working copy of the bioperl-dev trunk:

  >svn svn://code.open-bio.org/bioperl/bioperl-dev/trunk bioperl-dev

Issue the following command from within bioperl-dev/:

  >perl Build.PL

You can run regression tests and install bioperl-dev using the
following commands:

  >./Build test
