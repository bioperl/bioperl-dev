=head1 NAME

Bio::Tools::Run::AnalysisFactory::soap - A SOAP-based access to the list of analysis tools

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Do not use this object directly, it is recommended to access it and use
it through the I<Bio::Tools::Run::AnalysisFactory> module:

  use Bio::Tools::Run::AnalysisFactory;
  my $list = Bio::Tools::Run::AnalysisFactory->new(-access => 'soap')
     ->available_analyses;
  print join ("\n", @$list) . "\n";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

All public methods are documented in the interface module
C<Bio::Factory::AnalysisI>.

=head1 FEEDBACK

=head2 Mailing Lists

User feedback is an integral part of the evolution of this and other
Bioperl modules. Send your comments and suggestions preferably to
the Bioperl mailing list.  Your participation is much appreciated.

  bioperl-l@bioperl.org                  - General discussion
  http://bioperl.org/wiki/Mailing_lists  - About the mailing lists

=head2 Support 

Please direct usage questions or support issues to the mailing list:

I<bioperl-l@bioperl.org>

rather than to the module maintainer directly. Many experienced and 
reponsive experts will be able look at the problem and quickly 
address it. Please include a thorough description of the problem 
with code and data examples if at all possible.

=head2 Reporting Bugs

Report bugs to the Bioperl bug tracking system to help us keep track
of the bugs and their resolution. Bug reports can be submitted via the
web:

=head2 _initialize

 Usage   : my $factory = Bio::Tools::Run::AnalysisFactory->new(@args);
           (_initialize is internally called from the 'new()' method)
 Returns : nothing interesting
 Args    : This module recognises and uses following arguments:
             -location
             -httpproxy
             -soap
	   Additionally, the main module Bio::Tools::Run::AnalysisFactory
           recognises also:
             -access

It populates calling object with the given arguments, and then - for
some attributes and only if they are not yet populated - it assigns
some default values.

This is an actual new() method (except for the real object creation
and its blessing which is done in the parent class Bio::Root::Root in
method _create_object).

Note that this method is called always as an I<object> method (never as
a I<class> method) - and that the object who calls this method may
already be partly initiated (from Bio::Tools::Run::AnalysisFactory::new method);
so if you need to do some tricks with the 'class invocation' you need to
change Bio::Tools::Run::AnalysisFactory I<new> method, not this one.

=over

=item -location

A URL (also called an I<endpoint>) defining where is located a Web Service
functioning for this object.

Default is C<http://www.ebi.ac.uk/soaplab/services> (a service running
at European Bioinformatics Institute on top of most of the EMBOSS
analyses, and on top of few others).

For example, if you run your own Web Service using Java(TM) Apache Axis
toolkit, the location might be something like
C<http://localhost:8080/axis/services>.

=item -httpproxy

In addition to the I<location> parameter, you may need
to specify also a location/URL of an HTTP proxy server
(if your site requires one). The expected format is C<http://server:port>.
There is no default value.

=item -soap

Defines your own SOAP::Lite object. Useful if you need finer-grained
access to many features and attributes of the wonderful Paul Kulchenko's
module.
